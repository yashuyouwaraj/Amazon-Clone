# Amazon-Clone

A front-end clone of Amazon’s e-commerce experience built using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

## 📍 Project Overview

This project replicates the UI and basic flow of Amazon’s website. It includes pages such as home, checkout, orders, tracking etc., and is structured to demonstrate front-end skills (layout, styling, interactivity) using plain web technologies.
The codebase shows how you can create a multi-page shopping front-end with basic scripts and static data.

## 🔧 Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (vanilla)
* Static assets: images, styles, scripts

## 📁 Project Structure

```
/backend/       – (optional) backend folder (if any)  
/data/          – static data files (e.g., JSON)  
/images/        – images used in the UI  
/scripts/       – JavaScript files (logic)  
/styles/        – CSS files  
/tests/         – any test files  
checkout.html  
index.html  
orders.html  
tracking.html  
...  
```

(Adjust paths & names if they differ in your repo.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
* (Optional) A local HTTP server if you want to serve pages rather than opening file URLs

### Installation / Running Locally

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashuyouwaraj/Amazon-Clone.git  
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   cd Amazon-Clone  
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser (or serve via local server)

   ```bash
   # if you have Python installed  
   python3 -m http.server 8000  
   # then open http://localhost:8000 in browser  
   ```
4. Explore pages: home, checkout, orders, tracking etc.

## 🧭 Features

* Home page with product listings
* Checkout page to simulate purchase process
* Orders page to list past orders
* Tracking page to simulate shipment tracking
* Responsive design (to some degree)
* Static data files used to populate UI (no real backend)

## ✅ What’s Complete

* Core pages built and styled
* Basic navigation between pages
* Sample data loaded from `/data` folder
* Clean structure with separate folders for scripts, styles, images

## 🚧 What Could Be Improved / Next Steps

* Real backend/API integration for dynamic data
* User authentication & login flow
* Add shopping cart logic (add/remove items)
* Payment integration (simulation)
* Improved responsiveness & mobile-first layout
* Accessibility improvements (ARIA, keyboard nav)
* Unit tests / end-to-end tests for flows
* Optimize images and performance (lazy loading, minification)

## 📐 Code Style & Conventions

* CSS: BEM or utility-first naming recommended for future expansion
* JavaScript: modularize logic into ES6 modules if converting to bundler/framework
* HTML: semantic tags, proper alt attributes for images
* File structure: keep assets organized (styles, scripts, images)

If you like, I can **generate full documentation** including:

* Detailed folder-by-folder explanation
* Inline JS/CSS documentation (jsdoc style)
* A simple API specification (even though static)
* Example screenshots / how-to screenshots

Would you like me to create that extended documentation?
